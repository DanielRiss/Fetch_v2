Some weights of LlamaForTokenClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/dris/projects/Fetch_v2/verifier/Llama-3-8b-gsm8k-value-A and are newly initialized: ['score.bias', 'score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
